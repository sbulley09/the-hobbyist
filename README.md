# the-hobbyist

Following people on social media was a groundbreaking concept. This morphed into many branches such as following a group of people interested in the same hobby. What about following a specific person's journey from start to present in a hobby that you care about?

Currently, this doesn't exist. Following people leads to updates about everything and anything they want. Following an entire hobby page makes it hard to follow the journey. The Hobbyist aims to compartmentalize your favorite hobbyists and and allow you to follow their journies.
